# Code-Notes
Examples and explanations from different sources and experts about techniques I have found useful.

For the purposes of this page, and the examples contained in it, the term "modern" or "normal" C++ is C++ post the 2003 update, and in particular what was capable of being written with Boost circa 2002 and later. More specifically, by "normal" or "modern" C++ we mean C++11 and C++14 (and soon C++20) or code that used the Boost library, or the ACE/TAO frameworks and learnings generated by that community, or code that uses the best practices put forth by Doug Schmidt, Herb Sutter, Scott Meyers, and others in the research community.

Notably, "new" and "delete" are not used. Garbage collection (of all dynamic resources, not just memory, for example arrays, files, pipes) is done with shared_ptr<> and unique_ptr<> types. [RAII](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii) is used consistently. Standard algorithms and data structures are used rather than written by hand.

 The [GSL](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines) also codifies what we mean here.

# RCU
Dissertation: http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/RCU/RCUdissertation.2004.07.14e1.pdf

Read-copy update (RCU) is a synchronization mechanism that was added to the Linux kernel in October of 2002. RCU achieves scalability improvements by allowing reads to occur concurrently with updates. In contrast with conventional locking primitives that ensure mutual exclusion among concurrent threads regardless of whether they be readers or updaters, or with reader-writer locks that allow concurrent reads but not in the presence of updates, RCU supports concurrency between a single updater and multiple readers. RCU ensures that reads are coherent by maintaining multiple versions of objects and ensuring that they are not freed up until all pre-existing read-side critical sections complete. RCU defines and uses efficient and scalable mechanisms for publishing and reading new versions of an object, and also for deferring the collection of old versions. These mechanisms distribute the work among read and update paths in such a way as to make read paths extremely fast. In some cases (non-preemptable kernels), RCU's read-side primitives have zero overhead [LWN](http://lwn.net/Articles/262464/).

#Lock Free / Wait Free Data Structures

CDS is a C++ template library of lock-free and fine-grained algorithms. It contains a collection of concurrent data structure implementations

http://libcds.sourceforge.net/

A nice write up goes this this concurrent queue implementation:

Boost Lockfree

http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_62_0/doc/html/lockfree.html

Herb Sutter's proposal for atomic shared pointers has a  correct  and  ABA safe  implementation  of  a thread safe  singly  linked  list  that supports insert/erase at the front only (like a stack) but also supports finding values in the list. It is written entirely in portable C++ 11, except only that it uses the paper’s proposed atomic\<shared_ptr\<Node\>\>, which is discussed below.

# Hardware Transactional Memory

[C++ Transactional Memory](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/transactional_memory)

The idea behind hardware transactional memory is to allow two cores to execute code speculatively if they touch global state, and both should always succeed unless they touch the same bit of global state. For example, if two cores are updating entries in a tree, both will read from the root to a leaf and then each will modify one leaf. In a traditional locking model, you might have a single lock for the entire tree, so that accesses are serialized. With a transactional approach, each starts a transaction, walks to the desired node, and then updates it. The transactions would always succeed, unless both cores tried to update the same node.

In this case, the hardware keeps track of which cache lines have been read from and which have been written to. If another core reads the same cache line addresses as you do, there's no conflict. If either writes to a cache line that another has read or written to, then there's a conflict, and one of the transactions will fail. (Which one fails is defined by implementation.)

Easy to use synchronization construct
  -As easy to use as coarse-grain locks
  -Programmer declares, system implements

Often performs as well as fine-grain locks
   - Automatic read-read concurrency & fine-grain concurrency

Failure atomicity & recovery
   -No lost locks when a thread fails
   -Failure recovery = transaction abort + restart

Composability
  - Safe & scalable composition of software modules
  
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>
int f()
{
    static int i = 0;
    synchronized { // begin synchronized block
        std::cout << i << " -> ";
        ++i;       // each call to f() obtains a unique value of i
        std::cout << i << '\n';
        return i; // end synchronized block
    }
}
int main()
{
    std::vector<std::thread> v(10);
    for(auto& t: v)
        t = std::thread([]{ for(int n = 0; n < 10; ++n) f(); });
    for(auto& t: v)
        t.join();
}
```

# Handle Signals
Block signals on all threads so we don't have to worry about interrupted system calls and can be predictable about what thread will handle a signal.
```C++
// Block signals on all threads we create so that we don't
// have to worry about interrupted system calls and such things.
// Handle our signals in a thread in keeping with best practices
// for using signal with threads. See Butenhof, pg. 229.
//
// boost::asio::detail::posix_signal_blocker block_all_signals; // boost example to block everything.
//
// sigset_t new_mask, old_mask_; // Manual block everything.
// sigfillset(&new_mask);
// const bool blocked_ = (pthread_sigmask(SIG_BLOCK, &new_mask, &old_mask_) == 0);
 
// Block a few signals and listen for them via sigwait().
sigset_t oldmask{}, mask{};
sigemptyset(&mask);
sigaddset(&mask, SIGINT);
sigaddset(&mask, SIGQUIT);
sigaddset(&mask, SIGTERM);
sigaddset(&mask, SIGUSR1);
int err{};
if( (err = pthread_sigmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask, &oldmask )) != 0 )
{
  perror("unable to set signal mask");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
 
auto signal_handler = [](sigset_t& mask){
  int err{}, signo{};
  // Always use sigwait to work with asynchronous signals within
  // threaded code. [Butenhof, pg. 227] Synchronous signals include
  // SIGFPE, SIGSEGV, and SIGTRAP and are delivered to the thread
  // that caused the hardware exception always, regardless.
  err = sigwait( &mask, &signo );
  if( err )
  {
    perror("Failure waiting on signals.");
    std::abort();
  }
  switch( signo ){
    case SIGINT:
    case SIGQUIT:
    case SIGTERM:
      exit_signal_handler(signo);
      break;
    default:
      psignal( signo, "Unexpected signal received." );
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
  };
std::thread sig_handler( signal_handler, std::ref(mask) );
sig_handler.detach();
```
or with Boost perhaps you can do the following
```C++
#include <boost/asio.hpp>
#include <signal.h>
// Block signals on all threads we create so that we don't
// have to worry about interrupted system calls and such things.
// Handle our signals in a thread in keeping with best practices
// for using signal with threads. See Butenhof, pg. 229.
boost::asio::detail::posix_signal_blocker block_all_signals;
 
auto signal_handler = [](boost::asio::io_service& io_service ){
   sigset_t mask{};
   sigemptyset(&mask);
   sigaddset(&mask, SIGINT);
   sigaddset(&mask, SIGQUIT);
   sigaddset(&mask, SIGTERM);
   int err{}, signo{};
   // Always use sigwait to work with asynchronous signals within
   // threaded code. [Butenhof, pg. 227] Synchronous signals include
   // SIGFPE, SIGSEGV, and SIGTRAP and are delivered to the thread
   // that caused the hardware exception always, regardless.
   err = sigwait( &mask, &signo );
   if( err )
   {
     perror("Failure waiting on signals.");
     std::abort();
   }
   switch( signo ){
      case SIGINT:
      case SIGQUIT:
      case SIGTERM:
        io_service.stop();
        break;
      default:
        psignal( signo, "Unexpected signal received." );
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
};
 
daemon(0,0);
boost::asio::io_service io_service;
std::thread sig_handler(signal_handler, std::ref(io_service));
sig_handler.detach();
 
// We have on acceptor listening for connection attemps.
tcp_acceptor server(io_service);
 
// Run until SIGINT or SIGTERM is received.
io_service.run();
```

 
# Edit Distance & Levenshtein Distance

We used this algorithm in the in some clustering work.

    https://github.com/erikerlandson/edit_distance
    https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Strings/Levenshtein_distance#C.2B.2B
    http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kirk/cs1501/Pruhs/Fall2006/Assignments/editdistance/Levenshtein%20Distance.htm
```C++
// The "difference", or "distance", between two clusters of ids is defined
// in terms of the Levenshtein distance. The Levenshtein distance is a string
// metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the
// Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character
// edits (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one
// word into the other.
//
// This is also known, in the general case, as "edit distance" and we could
// just use the boost Sequence Algorithms.
//
// Note that it is assumed clusters are sorted by call id before the comparison.
//
// (Note: https://github.com/erikerlandson/edit_distance)
using cluster = std::vector<unsigned>;
 
inline unsigned
Levenshtein_distance(const cluster& s1, const cluster& s2)
{
  const std::size_t len1 = s1.size(), len2 = s2.size();
  std::vector<unsigned> col(len2+1), prevCol(len2+1);
  std::iota( prevCol.begin(), prevCol.end(), 0 );
 
  for(unsigned i = 0; i < len1; i++)
  {
    col[0] = i+1;
    for(unsigned j = 0; j < len2; j++)
    {
      col[j+1] = std::min({ prevCol[1 + j] + 1, col[j] + 1, prevCol[j] + (s1[i]==s2[j] ? 0 : 1) });
    }
    col.swap(prevCol);
  }
  return prevCol[len2];
}
```
# Container Sorted Insert
```C++
using container = std::vector<int>;
 
void insert( container &cont, int value ) {
    auto it = std::lower_bound( cont.begin(), cont.end(),
       value, std::greater<int>() ); // find proper position in descending order
    cont.insert( it, value ); // insert before iterator it
}
```
# Access Once

Not needed with C11/C++11 as you can just use an atomic type in general, perhaps applicable if you are implementing something like [RCU](http://www.rdrop.com/~paulmck/RCU/) with [memory_order_consume](https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2015/blob/master/Presentations/The%20Sad%20Story%20of%20memory_order_consume/The%20Sad%20Story%20of%20memory_order_consume%20-%20Paul%20E.%20McKenney%20-%20CppCon%202015.pdf). Never use [volatile for synchronization](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rconc-volatile).

Useful when referencing data in a multi-threaded app without memory barriers or other synchronization elements active in the function. Maybe a better name would be FORCE_ACCESS_HERE(), as suggested in the LWN article comments by mathstuf.

This avoids macros, works with volatile objects because the redundant volatile is legal, the type deduction and reference removal is implicit in the template signature, and it avoids the redundant address-of and deference operators common in another approaches (static casting between reference types is defined to do the same things as taking the address, casting and then dereferencing).
```C++
template<typename T>
inline T volatile &access_once(T &t) {
    return static_cast<T volatile &>(t);
}
```

# Thread Safe Interface Idiom

The thread safe interface is detailed in this paper http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/locking-patterns.pdf and is an approach to simplifying code and reducing lock contention. This approaches avoids dead locks. From the paper:

    Multi-threaded components typically contain multiple inter-
    face and implementation methods that perform computations
    on state that is encapsulated by the component. Component
    state is protected by a lock that prevents race conditions by
    serializing methods in the component that access the state.
    Component methods often call each other to carry out their
    computations. In multi-threaded components with poorly de-
    signed intra-component method invocation behavior, how-
    ever, the following forces will be unresolved:
    Avoid Self-deadlock:
    Thread-safe components should be designed to avoid ‘self-deadlock.’
    Self-deadlock will occur if one component method acquires a non-recursive
    component lock and calls another method that tries to reacquire the
    same lock.
    Minimal locking overhead:
    Thread-safe components should be designed to incur only the
    minimal locking over-head necessary to prevent race conditions.
    However, if a recursive component lock is selected to avoid the
    self-deadlock problem outlined above, additional overhead will be
    incurred to acquire and release the lock multiple times across intra-
    component method calls.
```C++
#include <thread>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <mutex>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
 
// Thread safe interface example.
struct active_object
{
  using Guard = std::lock_guard<std::mutex>;
 
  // Public methods acquire the lock and
  // call to the private implementation methods
  // passing the guard.
  void do_work( const int& item )
  {
    Guard g(mutex_);
    do_work( item, g );
  }
 
  private:
 
  // Private methods are always be called with the lock
  // held.
  void do_work( const int& item, Guard& g)
  {
    // We are free to call any private method.
    if( work_okay_to_do(item, g))
    {
      work_.push_back(item);
    }
    else
    {
      std::cout << "ignoring " << item << "\n";
    }
  }
   
  // Passing the guard ensures the lock is held: we
  // know we are the only thread accessing the data.
  bool work_okay_to_do( const int& item, Guard& ) const
  {
    return std::end(work_) ==
      std::find(std::begin(work_), std::end(work_), item);
  }
 
  mutable std::mutex mutex_;
  std::vector<int> work_;
};

# Count Cores & CPUs
See http://www.richweb.com/cpu_info for details.
From here:

    Num of CPU Sockets: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "physical id" | sort | uniq | wc -l
    Total number of cores: cat /proc/cpuinfo | egrep "core id|physical id" | tr -d "\n" | sed s/physical/
    nphysical/g | grep -v ^$ | sort | uniq | wc -l
    Also this helps to see the processor, core, socket relationship:    egrep "(( id|processo).*:|^ *$)" /proc/cpuinfo
    There is a */sys* interface also: /sys/devices/system/cpu
```C++
#include <sched.h>
 
void report_num_cpus()
{
    cpu_set_t cs;
    CPU_ZERO(&cs);
    unsigned count(0);
 
    // Won't adjust for hyperthreading: with hyperthreading
    // it reports double the number of actual cores.
    sched_getaffinity(0, sizeof(cs), &cs );
    for( size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(cs); ++i )
        if( CPU_ISSET(i, &cs) )
            ++count;
 
    std::cout << "Number of cpus: " << count << "\n";
}

# JSON example
With the normal C++ json library you can just write normal C++: Json can be treated as string literals, or STL like containers (https://github.com/nlohmann/json/#stl-like-access), with ease.
```C++
#include <sstream>
#include "json.hpp" // Normal C++ Json Library: https://github.com/nlohmann/json/
                    // https://github.com/nlohmann/json/#examples
 
void example() {
  // Write json.
  const nlohmann::json ping =
  {
    {"messageId", to_string(uuid)},
    {"event", "Ping"},
    {"source", "mcu"},  
    {"sourceId", i.binding_key()}, 
    {"version", "1.0"},
    {"timestamp", time_stamp.count()}, // Timestamp: milliseconds since epoch.
  };
  // create object from string literal
  json j = "{ \"happy\": true, \"pi\": 3.141 }"_json;
 
  // or even nicer with a raw string literal
  auto j2 = R"(
  {
    "happy": true,
    "pi": 3.141
  }
  )"_json;
  // deserialize from standard input
  json j;
  std::cin >> j;
 
  // serialize to standard output
  std::cout << j;
 
  // the setw manipulator was overloaded to set the indentation for pretty printing
  std::cout << std::setw(4) << j << std::endl; 
}

# Memory Barriers

Nice description here: http://lwn.net/Articles/576486/

Note the memory model of the Linux Kernel is different when compared to the memory model of C++11/C11, which is more relaxed, see:

    http://lwn.net/Articles/691128/ - "The C11 model is based on acquire/release semantics — one-way barriers that are described in the 2014 article and this article. Much of the kernel, instead, makes use of load/store barriers, which are stricter, two-way barriers."

# Atomic Shared Pointer
Atomic smart pointers are described in https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N4162.pdf (this is a small pdf and in appendix 5 - pg 9 - is a nice, simple, example) and are about making assignment of the pointer atomic, not just the reference counting, so that the following code can be written. Anthony Williams has an implementation here https://bitbucket.org/anthonyw/atomic_shared_ptr.

Having this ability has have made addressing the contention issues on MP much easier (as in we can just change the type in the std:vector<> we use, and eliminate many lines of code). This strategy also motivated the recent performance change on PSEMS, where we also could benefit from this approach in the future. A second example is here also.

# Serialize

Here is an example of persisting the contents of a class to a file and then recovering. Versioning is taken care of also and we can specify the version number for each class type if we like. Somethings to keep in mind are:

    * We only need to write the serialize() function.
    * We only need to pick out what elements of the class need to be serialized.
    * The Archive can be a file, a stream, a shared memory segment, memory mapped file, or a database: any type of storage or stream.


```C++

{
  std::string stuff_ = "details, details";

And from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28033251/can-you-extract-types-from-template-parameter-function-signature
```C++
#include <tuple>
 
struct type; // You can leave this undefined, because the template is
             // supposed to be instantiated with a function type, and
             // that is matched by the specialization below.
 
template<typename R, typename... Args>
struct type<R(Args...)>
{
    // Just use R and Args... as you with here..
};
```
And here is a possible usage example (live demo on Coliru):
```
#include <tuple>
#include <type_traits>
 
template<typename F, typename T, typename U>
decltype(auto) apply_invoke(F&& func, T&& first, U&& tuple) {
    return std::apply(std::forward<F>(func),
      std::tuple_cat(std::forward_as_tuple(std::forward<T>(first)),
           std::forward<U>(tuple)));
}
 
template<typename S>
struct signature;
 
template<typename R, typename... Args>
struct signature<R(Args...)>
{
    using return_type = R;
    using argument_type = std::tuple<Args...>;
};
 
int main()
{
    using ret = signature<void(int, double)>::return_type;
    using arg1 = std::tuple_element_t<0, signature<void(int, double)>::argument_type>;
    using arg2 = std::tuple_element_t<1, signature<void(int, double)>::argument_type>;
 
    static_assert(std::is_same<ret, void>{}, "!");
    static_assert(std::is_same<arg1, int>{}, "!");
    static_assert(std::is_same<arg2, double>{}, "!");
}
```
