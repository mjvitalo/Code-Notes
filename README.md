# RCU
Dissertation: http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/RCU/RCUdissertation.2004.07.14e1.pdf

Read-copy update (RCU) is a synchronization mechanism that was added to the Linux kernel in October of 2002. RCU achieves scalability improvements by allowing reads to occur concurrently with updates. In contrast with conventional locking primitives that ensure mutual exclusion among concurrent threads regardless of whether they be readers or updaters, or with reader-writer locks that allow concurrent reads but not in the presence of updates, RCU supports concurrency between a single updater and multiple readers. RCU ensures that reads are coherent by maintaining multiple versions of objects and ensuring that they are not freed up until all pre-existing read-side critical sections complete. RCU defines and uses efficient and scalable mechanisms for publishing and reading new versions of an object, and also for deferring the collection of old versions. These mechanisms distribute the work among read and update paths in such a way as to make read paths extremely fast. In some cases (non-preemptable kernels), RCU's read-side primitives have zero overhead [LWN](http://lwn.net/Articles/262464/).

#Lock Free / Wait Free Data Structures

CDS is a C++ template library of lock-free and fine-grained algorithms. It contains a collection of concurrent data structure implementations

A nice write up goes this this concurrent queue implementation:

Herb Sutter's proposal for atomic shared pointers has a  correct  and  ABA safe  implementation  of  a thread safe  singly  linked  list  that supports insert/erase at the front only (like a stack) but also supports finding values in the list. It is written entirely in portable C++ 11, except only that it uses the paper’s proposed atomic\<shared_ptr\<Node\>\>, which is discussed below.
